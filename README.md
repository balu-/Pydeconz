# pydeconz
Homeautomation Library for the tech savvy (depending on zigbee/deconz-rest)

__This should be a library to easily build home automation scripts on top of the deconz-rest api__
It can be used to easily issue comands to devices connected to deconz, subscribe to events and mix the two.
For example: on motion -> switch light on
